# PhySim2D

This is an old project of mine. I have made the source code available for anyone who likes learning by examples. Honestly, my taste and opinion have changed since then and I don’t think that the code quality is particularly good. I had a tendency to over-abstract everything which isn’t a good habit. If you are a beginner (a true beginner), I find it more useful to think of the problem as a closed-set problem instead of an open-set one and try to find the solution that will satisfy everything. Still, I am very proud of this project and I learned a lot from it.
